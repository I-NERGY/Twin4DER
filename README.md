# Description

In Twin4DER we focus on the development of Digital Twins (DTs) for power systems containing Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and interfacing them with applications that produce forecasting using AI models. The goal is to run power system simulations in combination with them and evaluate system level scenarios.

The underlying power system models of the DTs are based on real world networks from the pilots within the project.

The simulations are performed with the open-source real-time simulator [DPsim](https://github.com/sogno-platform/dpsim).
